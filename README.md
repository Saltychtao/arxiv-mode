arXiv-mode
==========

arxiv-mode is an [Emacs](www.gnu.org/s/emacs/â€Ž) major mode for viewing
updates on [arXiv.org](http://arxiv.org).

This is a fork of the original version of the arxiv-mode by Alex Chen (fizban007).
Several new functions and features are added to enhance the original mode.
I'm still working to improve the source code, so changes will happen frequently.

Common Usage
============

To start reading abstracts, run `M-x arxiv-read`, and enter the date
and category you would like to read.

You can also use `M-x arxiv-read-new` and `M-x arxiv-read-recent`
to browse new and recent submissions in the given category.
Use `M-x arxiv-read-author` to search for specific author(s).

For complex searches, use `M-x arxiv-complex-search`.
This command allows user to dynamically refine and modify search conditions.
You can also use `r` to refine search condition in the abstract list obtained from a complex search.

In the article list, use `n` and `p` to navigate the article list.
Press `SPC` to toggle visibility of the abstract window. Press
`RET` to open the entry in a web browser. Press `d` to download the pdf.
Press `q` to exit the mode.

Installation
============

Just put the directory in your filesystem and at it to your
`load-path`. Put the following into your `.emacs` file

````lisp
(require 'arxiv-mode)
````

Customization
=============

`arxiv-mode` can be customized through emacs native customization
interface. Currently only a few variables can be modified but others
will be added as code develops. These can be found under the group
`arxiv`, or just run `arxiv-customize`.
